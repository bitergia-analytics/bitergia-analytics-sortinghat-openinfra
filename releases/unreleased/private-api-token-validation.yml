title: Private API token validation
category: fixed
author: Jose Javier Merchante <jjmerchante@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: |
  The previous code incorrectly compared the status code against '400'
  instead of '401' when validating the private API token. As a result,
  unauthorized access was not properly handled.
